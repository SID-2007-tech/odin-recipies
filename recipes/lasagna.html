    <h1>Down below is a lasagna recipe</h1>
    <img src="../recipes/lasagna.html" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a celebrated Italian baked dish built from wide, flat pasta
      sheets layered with savory fillings. It features a rich harmony of
      flavors, typically stacking a hearty meat ragù against a creamy cheese or
      béchamel center. The dish is slowly oven-baked until the layers meld
      together and the top develops a golden, bubbly crust. As a global comfort
      food staple, it is prized for its ability to be both a rustic family meal
      and an elegant centerpiece. Each slice offers a perfect cross-section of
      tender pasta, melted cheese, and robust sauce in every bite.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>noodle sheets</li>
      <li>Meat sauce</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare the Noodles: Regular Noodles: Boil in salted water for 8–10
        minutes until al dente (firm to the bite). Drain and rinse with cool
        water to prevent sticking. No-Boil Noodles: Skip this step; they will
        cook in the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the Meat Sauce: In a large skillet or Dutch oven, cook ground beef
        (and sausage if using) over medium heat until browned. Add the diced
        onion and cook until soft. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
        Drain excess grease. Stir in tomato paste, tomatoes/marinara, sugar,
        oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 15-30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the Cheese Filling: In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese,
        beaten egg, Parmesan cheese, parsley, and salt until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble the Lasagna: Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Bottom Layer:
        Spread 1 cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish to
        prevent sticking. Layer 1: Lay 3-4 noodles over the sauce. Spread 1/3 of
        the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by 1 cup of mozzarella
        cheese, and 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat: Repeat the layers (noodles,
        ricotta, mozzarella, meat sauce) two more times. Top Layer: Finish with
        a final layer of noodles, the remaining meat sauce, and the rest of the
        mozzarella and parmesan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake: Cover the pan with aluminum foil (tip: spray the underside with
        cooking spray so the cheese doesn't stick). Bake for 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the foil and bake for another 15-20 minutes until the cheese is
        bubbly and slightly browned. 6. Cool and Serve: Let the lasagna stand
        for at least 15-20 minutes before slicing. This is crucial for holding
        the layers together.
