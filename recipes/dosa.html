    <h1>Down below is a dosa recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/dosa.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Dosa is a staple South Indian crepe made from a fermented batter of ground
      rice and black gram (urad dal). It is prized for its unique texture,
      featuring a lacy, golden-brown crispness on the outside and a slightly
      soft, tangy interior. Traditionally cooked on a flat griddle, it is often
      served alongside spicy sambar and a variety of fresh coconut chutneys.
      While the plain version is a classic, the "Masala Dosa" filled with a
      spiced potato mash is one of the most popular variations worldwide. Rich
      in carbohydrates and proteins due to the fermentation process, it is a
      versatile dish enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Rice</li>
      <li>lentils</li>
      <li>oil</li>
      <li>chana dal</li>
      <li>coconut</li>
      <li>Fresh veggies</li>
      <li>Spices and Salt</li>
      <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse and Soak: In one bowl, rinse 3 cups of parboiled rice and 1 cup of
        raw rice. In a separate bowl, rinse 1 cup of urad dal and 1 tsp of
        fenugreek seeds. Soak both in plenty of water for 4 to 6 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain: After soaking, drain the excess water, but keep a small cup of
        the soaking water aside—it contains wild yeast that helps with
        fermentation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grind the Dal: Using a wet grinder or a high-speed blender, grind the
        urad dal and fenugreek seeds with a little chilled water until the paste
        is fluffy, light, and smooth. Transfer to a large pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grind the Rice: Grind the rice with just enough water to create a
        slightly grainy consistency (like fine semolina).
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix: Combine the rice and dal pastes in the pot. Add a teaspoon of salt
        and mix thoroughly with your hands (the natural heat and bacteria from
        your hands actually jumpstart the fermentation!).
      </li>
      <li>
        Rest: Cover the pot and leave it in a warm, dark place for 8 to 12
        hours. The batter is ready when it has nearly doubled in volume and
        smells slightly tangy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the Tawa: Heat a flat, non-stick or cast-iron griddle over medium
        heat. Lightly grease it with a few drops of oil and wipe it off.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Swirl: Pour a ladleful of batter in the center. Starting from the
        middle, use the back of the ladle to spiral the batter outward in a
        circular motion until you have a thin, even crepe.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crisp: Drizzle a teaspoon of oil or ghee around the edges. Cook until
        the bottom turns golden brown and the edges start to lift.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold: Once crispy, fold the dosa in half or roll it into a cylinder.
        There is usually no need to flip it, as the thin batter cooks through
        quickly.
      </li>
    </ol>
